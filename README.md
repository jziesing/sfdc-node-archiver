# SFDC Node Archiver

## Easily Archive your Salesforce data onto Postgres and even S3 with the power of Heroku!

#### This project demonstrates how to archive Salesforce data with Heroku. It uses [Heroku Connect](https://www.heroku.com/connect) to replicate Salesforce data into Heroku Postgres, [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) to have a secure database without any administration, [Salesforce Connect](https://www.salesforce.com/form/conf/platform/salesforce-connect/?leadcreated=true&redirect=true&d=cta-body-promo-318&nc=7013y000002pd0BAAQ) to view your archived data in Salesforce without storing it there, and [Heroku Dynos](https://www.heroku.com/dynos) to quickly and successfully run code in a secure environment in the cloud.  It also uses a few custom Salesforce components.  Take a look at the instructions on how to set it up!
